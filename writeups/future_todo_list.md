#To Do List


One of the biggest issues is as mentioned in our security audit we cannot prevent people from voting twice if they have access to the url. We want to avoid this as mentioned in the security audit:


**We do not have a login service and much like SurveyMonkey, at least thus far, our voting system is based on people having received the URL. However, we are not logging users when they vote which will result in people able to vote infinitely. A way to avoid this would be to take the IP of the people who have voted previously and then log them into a user database that works in the opposite way that we have typically used a user database in that it will not allow those ‘logged on’ to vote again. You can use a VPN to get around this so we will also think of another way to do it. Alternatively, if you know which group you are sending the voting system to, such as PA, then you could use the logins already used in that system and piggyback off their database of users and not allow that user back in after voting.**


Make the app more visually stimulating and something unique as an alternative to the twitter bootstrap.


Ideally and if given enough time the voting system could also take information about the user for in depth data analysis and prediction using machine learning and neural networks. This is super unethical given that we will not be telling people we will be doing this but can provide invaluable data to our corporate sponsors and make lots of money.


Create a logo for the app so that it will be available in the app store and not just in browser, as well make the app scalable for mobile browsers.  


Eventually create different voting systems and allow the creator of the 'survey' to choose it i.e. ranked based voting.
