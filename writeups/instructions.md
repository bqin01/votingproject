#Instructions on How to Use Voting App


In the model of SurveyMonkey this app will function through sending a url to the parties that we want to vote. From there we have prebuilt options on who/what to vote for as well as a write in option. From there you will be redirected to another page where you can see the results of the election up until that point and if you actively reload that page it will update the votes. In our current model we have also included an option to vote again to show the functionality of the app, but it will be removed in future versions.

In the `/results` page, it is possible to click on each candidate to direct them to a page designed for them (`/candid/id`) that will show the times at which people voted for this candidate.
